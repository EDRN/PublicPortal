Release Notes - Early Detection of Cancer - Version Portal 4.5.2 - 2015-01-06

** Bug
    * [CA-1295] - Infinite loop in functional test, but only on some platforms

This release also updates publications ingest to ignore all of the error-prone
data from the DMCC's publications feed and use only the PubMedID.  The portal
accesses the PubMed database to retrieve accurate details about each
publication.  It also displays the publications in a cleaner format, and hides
the right-side portlets on the publications tab.

In addition, this release

* Fixes an infinite loop in EDRN collaborative groups.
* Addresses an issue in RDF ingest of biomarker data where information about how
  a biomarker affects a bodysystem refers to a non-existent biomarker.
* Fixed LabCAS integration by including a missing API.
* Works around bad site data from the DMCC.

This product, ``eke.specimens``, provides display and RDF_ ingest of
ERNE (EDRN Resource Network Exchange) specimens for the Early Detection
Research Network (EDRN_) Knowledge Environment (EKE_).  EDRN uses the EKE to
make it easy to discover, share, search for, and retrieve all of EDRN's
collective knowledge, including cancers and other diseases, biomarkers,
publications, investigators, participants, studies, protocols, and-as in the
case of this product-specimens.

Although intended for the EDRN public portal, it can be installed in any
Plone_ compatible site.

This software is developed by the `EDRN Informatics Center`_  at JPL_,
operated by the California Institute of Technology, for NCI_.

Installation
============

Use Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.

* Add ``eke.publications`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        eke.specimens
        
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
  
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        eke.specimens
        
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
  
    % ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
